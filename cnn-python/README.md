# Task C: Fruit Detection and Plate Recognition with CNN

Detecting fruit and recognizing plates using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## 📚 Overview

This project implements fruit detection and plate recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). For fruit detection we utilize U-Net architecture, and for plate recognition we use a CNN pretrained model EasyOCR.

## 🚀 Quick Start
### 1. Go to Project Directory

```bash
cd cnn-python
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
python main_gui.py
```
